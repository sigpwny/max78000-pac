_modify:
  # Interrupt value fixes:
  # - Interrupt values should not include the first 15 IRQs, since those are 
  #   for ARM Cortex-M4 exceptions.
  # - Interrupt values are 0-indexed and IRQ numbers are 1-indexed.
  # - To convert IRQ numbers in the MAX78000 User Guide to interrupt values, 
  #   subtract the IRQ number by 16.
  # - Most interrupt values in the SVD file are correct, but some incorrectly 
  #   use the IRQ number.
